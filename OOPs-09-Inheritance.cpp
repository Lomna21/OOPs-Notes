//  INHERITANCE --> It is a process of inheriting properties and behavours of existing class into a new class.

// ------Syntax-------- 
// class base_class_name{
// };
// class  derived_class_name : access-specifier  base_class_name{
//        //    body ....
// };
// --> If no access-specifier is used then it will be private by default.

// -------Types of Inheritance------
// 1. Single Inheritance
// 2. Multi level Inheritance
// 3. Multiple Inheritance
// 4. Hierarchical Inheritance
// 5. Hybrid Inheritace 

// C++ program to show that a derived class doesnâ€™t inherit access to private data members.
// However, it does inherit a full parent object.

class A {
    public:
        int x;
    protected:
        int y;
    private:
        int z;
};
class B : public A {
    // x is public
    // y is protected
    // z is not accessible from B
};
class C : protected A {
    // x is protected
    // y is protected
    // z is not accessible from C
};
class D : private A{ // 'private' is default for classes
    // x is private
    // y is private
    // z is not accessible from D
};

// Constructors and Destructors in Inheritance

// --> Constructors and Destructors are generally defined by the programmer and if not, the compiler automatically creates them so they are present in every class in C++. Now, the question arises what happens to the constructor and destructor when a class is inherited by another class.
// --> In C++ inheritance, the constructors and destructors are not inherited by the derived class, but we can call the constructor of the base class in derived class.

// --> The constructors will be called by the complier in the order in which they are inherited. It means that base class constructors will be called first, then derived class constructors will be called.
// --> The destructors will be called in reverse order in which the compiler is declared.
